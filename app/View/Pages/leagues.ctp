		<h2>User-defined Leagues</h2>
	</header>
	<p>This year, you will be able to create your own leagues within Goalmine. In the same way as the Euro 2012 Goalmine, or many other fantasy football websites, allow you to do.</p>
	<p>Any player can <a href="/leagues/add">submit an application</a> to create a new league. If approved by Goalmine admins, then that league is created and the player becomes the league administrator.</p>
	<p>Leagues may be created as public or private. Any player can join a public league without restriction or approval. To join a private league you must click on the 'apply' button on that league's page. You will receive an email when the league organiser has approved or rejected your request.</p>
	<p>Everyone plays the same set of matches each week, so your score will be the same for each league of which you're a member. This means you may be first in one league, but bottom of another depending on other scores.</p>
